**Focus Areas:**
* **Conciseness & Impact:** Tighten sentences and make every word count.
* **Rhythm & Flow:** Vary sentence structure and length to create a compelling narrative pace.
* **Vocabulary & Imagery:** Use a diverse and evocative vocabulary to sharpen imagery.

**Key Rules:**
* **Avoid Echoes:** Actively check approximately five paragraphs before and after the current section for repeated words, phrases, and sentence structures.
* **Track Overuse:** Keep a mental list of frequently used words and expressions to ensure they are not overused.
* **Punctuation Style:** Avoid using em-dashes (â€”) for stylistic pauses, opting for other punctuation like commas, colons, or sentence breaks.

**Process:** Apply edits directly to the text. Return ONLY the fully edited text, without any additional comments, preambles, or explanations.`;
